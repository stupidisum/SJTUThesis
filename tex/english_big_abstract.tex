\chapter{DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AIR QUALITY SENSOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM}

In recent years, with the heating topics like haze and PM2.5, air quality has gradually become a social focus of China and even the world. Now gentlemen have to talk about in daily chat not only the weather but also the air. Although there is an endless stream of historic, real-time, forecast air quality websites and applications nowadays, almost all of them get air quality data from monitoring stations of government environmental department and only a few of them built their own monitoring sites. However, air quality is more complex than weather. Time and space have greater impact on it than weather. And it has greater impact on people's health than weather. Therefore, how to meet the individuals' willing to grasp the real-time air quality nearby has become a major problem.

'Clarity Movement Co.', hereinafter referred to as Clarity, is a start-up company developed the "world's smallest air quality sensor". The current second-generation sensor is about the same size as a matchbox which has extremely increased its portability while still has accuracy not weaker than the optical air quality analyzer. The main sales channel of Clairty is to cooperate with the relevant business and government and to mount the sensor on conventional hardware devices and urban facilities. Now, Clairty have built up their own cloud services platform on which sensors upload air quality data through WiFi or smart phone's bluetooth and the data can be stored, processed, and pushed to any client by the server. However, to show how powerful the cloud is, Clarity still need an information system to control and manage sensors including view and download air quality data.

On the one hand, with the development of Clarity's business, Clarity's internal staff need an information system to manage their sensors produced by them and sensors' information, like versions, batches and owners. On the other hand, Clarity's cooperators, who tend to be government departments and traditional hardware manufacturers such as companies in industry of home appliance and automotive, generally do not have strong capabilities of software development, so Clarity need to customize appropriate sensor management system for them to view air quality data and manageme sensing devices. Thus, what this paper researches, Air Quality Sensor Management System, hereinafter referred to as this system, came into being. This system should be a modern Full-Stack JavaScript WEB application to meet the requirements of Clarity's informatization and the needs of growing-up business with features like real-time, single-page, responsive, modular, etc.

This study aims to ensure the design and implementation of this system is under the circumstance of adequate theoretical guidance, sufficient technical reserves, efficient development tools, detailed requirement analysis, timely user feedback and comprehensive test plan. This study firstly researches related theories, techniques and tools and learns or improves knowledge of some never-learned or unfamiliar ones of them, such as ReactJS, which the author has never touched and self-learns during the process of developing according to development team's technical reserves and development capabilities, combined with the company's corporate culture and economic level. Secondly, this study analyse the requirements exhaustively and positive communication, dig demand, sometimes even find some demand side thought they did not need to give a series of follow-up the development of helpful documents, graphics and design; development process frequently deployment, and timely access to input and feedback on the demand side, and timely bug fixes and regulatory requirements are dissatisfied with the place. Design and resolutely implement the testing program, testing and development process synchronization even earlier, unit testing and manual testing combined, while safeguarding local codes for software robustness and overall functionality.

Although generally speaking the sensor management system, but demand does have some relationship to each other small parts, it is necessary to be divided into relatively independent but interrelated modules. First, the internal sensor management needs, primarily the management of the versions, the system defines it as "Version Management Module" followed by the demand for partners, family and individual levels can be divided into the "Smart Home Module" and the city level "Smart City block."

Oriented user management module version is Clarity hardware developers, users had to use Excel record sensor version, the batch, the owner and other information, but with the continuous improvement of the sensor, more and more partners, partners to make special release more and more parts purchase batches are different, using Excel time costs and increasing energy costs.
. The system needs to be able to allow users to CRUD complex relationship sensors, users, compatibility, hardware version, firmware version, software version or five parts and batch versions and five kinds of parts between these resources, we need to deal with some special check format, so when the user input validation and receive timely feedback.

Smart Home module for traditional consumer electronics manufacturers want to build smart home, the current main target is a Japanese appliance manufacturers, end-users is the use of smart home appliances and personal. Common air purifier only been open or under human control intermittently clean the air, equipped with appliances and air mass sensor can only detect air quality and reported to the user, and can not actually improve air quality, Clarity in two among those who introduced a burning program programmable intelligent sweeping robot cleverly compensate for the shortcomings of both. Accept the server's command robot to move to a different room where the sensor and turn on the air purifier, the server in real time to detect changes in air quality in the room to give instructions to the robot. Users can view and work on WEB application position the robot can also be controlled manually, you can also view the current status and history of air quality air in different rooms.

Smart Home want to build modules for Smart City car manufacturers or government, currently the main target customers are the United States plan to do a smart city government departments, end users are government workers. Users want to be able to add and delete applications on the WEB, show and hide devices (sensors), a map in the form of visual display and the current air quality sensor position, graphically intuitive display real-time data of some equipment and the latest historical data to csv form different devices, the time span, air quality and air quality data precision time measurement.

The important business logic do unit testing, the entire application made end to end testing, and then use the Solano CI do continuous integration, the production branch (ie the main branch, master branch), use the AWS provided code pipeline service automatic deployment.

The system basically completed all the requirements, and formally launched all three modules are running.

Smart Home is the first module on the line, in the Clarity and target customers (of the Japanese home appliance business) negotiations, the other side actually see a strong Clarity software development capabilities and cloud services platform thus reached a cooperation. In this system there before, others invisible, Clarity does not know what cloud services platform role.

Clarity is the wisdom of the city's current business focus, the city government of the United States is very important to a Clarity partner at Clarity wisdom of this city needs to explore the process, Smart City block after several big changes in demand, and ultimately the first two on-line, provides a very powerful data visualization capabilities, and downloads.

Demand version management module priority is the lowest in the initial planning, so it is the last one to start developing the system, but so-called "Preparation may quicken the workers", although the development of additional code generator takes up some of the energy but instead it is the shortest development cycle. Receiving user feedback and constantly being improved.

The author in the side of the development process while learning ReactJS and Redux, the constantly updated software development and awareness of these two technologies, continue to find better or best practices of others (Best Practice), not only to the I grew up personal technology, but also let me in this era of software industry and JavaScript more love in the world.

Version management module gave me a big surprise that although the company doing private projects, but still have the opportunity to contribute code to the open source community, and that is part of the work, I also became a contributor to the open source world.
